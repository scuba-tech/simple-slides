#  Controls

## Key Bindings

- Advance slide: **right**, **down**, and **space** keys
- Previous slide: left, up keys
- Fullscreen toggle on selected window: **F** key
- Clone Window: **C** key
    - yes, original and cloned windows are synchronized
    - great for presenting (P-toggle one, and fullscreen the other)
- Presenter's toggle: **P** key
- Help: **H** key

# Other features

KaTeX for math representaion:

$$F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{f(x)}dx + C$$

Mermaid for graph:

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR;
  A --> B(yes)
  B --> C
  C --> A
  C --> B
  D --> C
</div>

Code blocks can be syntax highlighted by specifying a language from the set of [supported languages](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration#highlighting).

Using *pull-left* and *pull-right* along with code-blocks:

.pull-left[

```javascript
function add(a, b)
  return a + b
end
```
]
.pull-right[

```ruby
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end
```
]

Yay, it works. Here's another paragraph.

.red[**This is the last slide with content.**]

(A blank slide has been intentionally inserted after this one.)
